My personal website, built using Next.JS (13+).

## Why Next?

Flavor-of-the-month(-or-year?) framework and it's relatively fun and easy to use. Reminds me of working with Angular 5/6 but with none of the CLI nonsense and cruft. The Vercel aesthetic that's polluted startup design everywhere IS a little overstated though I'll admit.

## Do u hate Ruby/ Jekyll now :(

Nah. Too much stuff I wanna do requires me to break out of both SSR and Markdown-based editing. If I'm creating raw HTML I'd rather do it in the way that's most ergonomic. Most of the stuff here is still gonna be SSR'd anyway :)

### Why not just React in Jekyll

JS tooling starts to become a real PITA when you want to do lots of custom stuff once you're outside of webpack/ babel land. And I'm a fraidy cat!

### Ok well why don't you just

Get lost!

## Well are you gonna write more content.....

if the lexapro permits.................

## How do u deploy

Vercel hobby edition + porkbun as registrar and DNS (RIP GOOGLE DOMAINS YE SHALL BE MISSED DEARLY)

### You say you hate the Vercel aesthetic and yet you use Vercel a lot... interesting...

someone actually said this to me once. please shut up

## Ok when are you gonna try Svelte

(: try again next year
